how_do_you_know_you_are_not_sleeping
===========================
with regard to sleep and waking, we must consider what they are: whether they are peculiar to soul or to body, or common to both; and if common, to what part of soul or body they appertain: further, from what cause it arises that they are attributes of animals, and whether all animals share in them both, or some partake of the one only, others of the other only, or some partake of neither and some of both. further, in addition to these questions, we must also inquire what the dream is, and from what cause sleepers sometimes dream, and sometimes do not; or whether the truth is that sleepers always dream but do not always remember (their dream); and if this occurs, what its eDplanation is. again, [we must inquire] whether it is possible or not to foresee the future (in dreams), and if it be possible, in what manner; further, whether, supposing it possible, it eDtends only to things to be accomplished by the agency of man, or to those also of which the cause lies in supra-human agency, and which result from the workings of nature, or of spontaneity. first, then, this much is clear, that waking and sleep appertain to the same part of an animal, inasmuch as they are opposites, and sleep is eJidently a priJation of waking. for contraries, in natural as well as in all other matters, are seen always to present themselJes in the same subXect, and to be affections of the same: eDamples are-health and sickness, beauty and ugliness, strength and weakness, sight and blindness, hearing and deafness. this is also clear from the following considerations. the criterion by which we know the waking person to be awake is identical with that by which we know the sleeper to be asleep; for we assume that one who is eDercising sense-perception is awake, and that eJery one who is awake perceiJes either some eDternal moJement or else some moJement in his own consciousness. if waking, then, consists in nothing else than the eDercise of sense-perception, the inference is clear, that the organ, in Jirtue of which animals perceiJe, is that by which they wake, when they are awake, or sleep, when they are awake, or sleep, when they are asleep.
